**This is a standalone application which requires Oracle database installed into your device(which we might change to client-server architecture).**
Football fans around the world need every single knowledge about their favourite players ,clubs and international teams. This project is inspired by the fact that many football fans are unable to follow their favourite team matches for some reasons.To get this information easily we are creating a standalone application to provide a friendly environment to maintain the details of players ,Team, League and every record needed. 
       This application presents the info pertaining to a Football League. This includes playerâ€™s data which includes their name, place of birth, goals scored, etc and provides Information about different coaches. It also focuses on the clubs involved in the league, the information about the clubs like the CEO of the club, the manager, etc.Also, information about matches like the teams involved, the goal timestamps, penalties, referees, substitutions, etc and most importantly this tells us about the well known awards around the world.
